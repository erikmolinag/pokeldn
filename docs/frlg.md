# FireRed and LeafGreen

The Switch release of FireRed and LeafGreen is the original GBA ROM running inside an emulator, so
two link layers are stacked:

| layer | whose | documented in |
|---|---|---|
| LDN and Pia | the emulator's, shared with every other Switch title | [The wireless layer](ldn.md) |
| the GBA link: RFU frames, seats, block sends | the ROM's | these pages |

[pret/pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered) is authoritative for the whole game-level
protocol at `REVISION >= 0xA`. Cartridge header, read off both consoles: software version `0x0A`,
game code `BPRF` (FireRed, French) and `BPGF` (LeafGreen, French). The host also selects measured
ROM and RAM addresses for the English, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese pairs, twelve
cartridges in total. Mystery Gift detects the language from the cartridge code after the
player chooses pokeldn in the Friend list; the Basic screen shows this beside the version. The added languages have offline ROM and mGBA checks; wireless delivery
on those editions still requires retail verification. See [The cartridge maps](frlg_rom_map.md#the-international-revision-0x0a-cartridges).

A console that leaves about three seconds after associating, once the Pia session has finalized,
was given an association response without 6, 9 and 12 Mbit/s ([frlg_link.md](frlg_link.md), The
advertised rate set); a missing Pia type 2 Join Response gives the same symptom.

## What works

On retail hardware, on both cartridges, the host serves every activity the console offers: Mystery
Gift in both directions, trade as host and as joiner, the whole Union Room including full link
battles, Wonder News, the cable-club colosseum, and a visiting Battle Tower trainer.

Through the gift link's two interpreters the console also runs code sent to it: its memory read and
written, its ROM mapped into named functions for the build it runs, its own functions called with
eight arguments, and a Pokemon chosen by the host built by its own `CreateMon` and left in the
player's party. The RNG is closed end to end; an aimed shiny encounter costs one A press per
attempt.

The guest-to-wrapper boundary is decoded ([Code on the
console](frlg_rom.md#where-the-boundary-stands)): the guest's one store past a region's backing
is byte-precise and constant-valued, a planted pointer's consumers read their targets from
`main`'s own data at static addresses, and the syscalls' stores into the component are read
back as counts and GBA addresses, every address bounds-checked. The wrapper's own scan
pipeline is decoded to its first stage ([The wrapper's own scan
pipeline](frlg_rom.md#the-wrappers-own-scan-pipeline)): the scan results, the consume loop
and the parent-candidate list are all fixed-shape and bounded, and the one length-taking
path (a station name, at most `0x40`) is clamped at its caller.

## The two cartridges

LeafGreen runs the same code at a piecewise-constant offset; the measured pairs and the boundaries
are on [LeafGreen](frlg_leafgreen.md). Never predict an address across an unbracketed boundary.

## Rules that hold across all of it

- The decomp's link order is evidence; its addresses need measuring on the cartridge.
  `pokeldn/frlg/rom/rom_map.py` records how each address was obtained.
- A payload runs offline under unicorn (`buffer_script.emulate`, `emulate_repeating`, both simulated
  consoles) before it is sent. One that faults or never returns 1 hangs the Mystery Gift menu with
  no way out; a field stub that loops forever freezes the overworld.
