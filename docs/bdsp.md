# Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl

Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are built in Unity by ILCA, with IL2CPP game code directly on
Pia.

Measured against a French Shining Pearl, version 1.3.0, in the Union Room (Pokemon Center 2F, the
left attendant, the plain "yes") and in the Grand Underground.

## Status

Working on retail hardware:

- A seat in the console's session with only `prod.keys` and the LDN passphrase; every packet
  decrypted; the send path byte-exact against the console's own ciphertext.
- The Local, Mesh Station and Mesh Protocol handshakes, the RTT timer and the reliable transport
  in both directions.
- A character walking in a retail Union Room, showing a trade emote, and running the game's own
  greeting dialogue with the player.
- A complete trade: the console's offer, an assembled Pokemon accepted, the save written; trades
  chain in one association ([Trading](bdsp_trade.md#the-completed-trade)).
- Hosting: a console entering the Union Room joins a room pokeldn hosts, draws its character, and
  completes a trade with it ([Hosting](bdsp_session.md#hosting)).
- A composed ball capsule exchanged in the Union Room; the console stores it in its collection with
  the seals the player has in stock ([the protocol page](bdsp_protocol.md)).
- Record mixing and a battle lobby, up to the console's record and its six chosen Pokemon.
- A character walking on the Grand Underground floor, and the console's secret base read out.

## Unresolved

- A substituted greeting name on a console's screen
  ([The name in the greeting](bdsp_protocol.md#the-name-in-the-greeting)). How `StartupSessionJob`
  fills the own station's record at +0x480 from the startup setting is untraced.
- Whether a 0x08 to a console that has never recruited a battle faults it on hardware. The code
  writes through a null model; no 0x08 has reached that path, because those sent went out under
  sequence ids the reliable window had already seen ([The battle
  ladder](bdsp_protocol.md#the-battle-ladder)). Whether leaving the Union Room destroys the
  `UnionRoomManager` is unread (`UnionRoomManager$$OnDestroy` `0x1e4c540` exists; its caller is not
  known).
- Whether a retail console that is not the Grand Underground session host adopts a 0x61 from
  pokeldn; the Underground sessions measured had the console as host, and pokeldn does not host one.
  The common dispatch and the `UgNetworkManager` handler have no sender filter
  ([the protocol page](bdsp_protocol.md#the-grand-underground)).
- What makes a console in the Union Room stop advertising with no change on screen
  ([Taking a seat](bdsp_session.md#taking-a-seat)).
- The text of `SS_box_182`, the message `BoxWindow.SetSendPokemon` selects for a flagged Pokemon in
  a trade, and what `RequestValidateTrade` checks for an online trade
  ([Duplicate detection](bdsp_trade.md#duplicate-detection)).
- Where the Unity player takes `Screen.width` from. The 2D grid positions rest on it being the
  1280 x 720 default that `0x6062e8` keeps when `/Data/rawsettings` +0x1c is 0
  ([the protocol page](bdsp_protocol.md#the-grand-underground)); another source, such as the
  player settings in `globalgamemanagers`, has not been excluded.
- Whether any scene places a `UnionRoomManager` or a `UgNetworkManager` as a component. The code's
  only `AddComponent` of each is read; a scene-placed instance would live outside those paths.
